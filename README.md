# discordBot
I made a bot for my discord and put it on my server in three days. While I was coding the bot I found a lack of resources on how to use discord.js commando and how to set a bot up on a server for free. I am now trying to fill this gap with this bot. This document will walk you through from start to finish on how to make a bot in discord. I just started learning node.js and using discord.js so I am new at this too. I expect you to know how to use a computer, make accounts, and download programs lets begin,

# Step 1 Accounts
first you will need a couple of accounts to some services.
 
As one would expect you need an account for discord if you do not have one make one here: https://discordapp.com/register

Next you will need an account to the cloud hosting service Heroku. Make one here: https://signup.heroku.com/login

Thats all you need onto step two.

# Step 2 Downloads

You will need a couple of programs to get your bot set up.

First you need an IDE or integrated development environment. I would suggest visual studio code or atom below are the download links

VisualStudio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

Atom : https://atom.io

This git download it: https://github.com/TheJewGamer/discordBot

# Step 3 Making the bot

Now lets make your bot go to the link below and sign in.

https://discordapp.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications%2Fme

click the new app button. Then type in the name of your bot in app name. The click the button at the bottom right it should say create app. Now click create a bot user and do it. Now your going to want to click on the blue text next to token. DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH OTHERS IT WILL LET THEM LOG IN AS YOUR BOT. Copy the text that replaces the blue text into a notepad or something and keep it around as we will need it later. Also copy the text next to Client ID it should just be some numbers.

# Step 4 Adding the bot to a server

To add a bot to a server you must have permisions to do so. If you do not you will not be able to, making your own server is a sure way to make sure you are able to add the bot. Next go to the link and select the permsions you want your bot to have and put the bot's Client ID where it says to, its under OAuth URL Generator. Then click the link it provides you and add your bot to the server.
