# discordBot
I made a bot for my discord and put it on a server in three days. While I was coding the bot I found a lack of resources on how to use discord.js commando and how to set a bot up on a server for free. I am now trying to fill this gap with this bot. This document will walk you through from start to finish on how to make a bot in discord. I just started learning node.js and using discord.js so I am new at this too. I expect you to know how to use a computer, make accounts, and download programs lets begin,

# Step 1 Accounts
first you will need a couple of accounts to some services.
 
As one would expect you need an account for discord if you do not have one make one here: https://discordapp.com/register

Next you will need an account to the cloud hosting service Heroku. Make one here: https://signup.heroku.com/login

Thats all you need onto step two.

# Step 2 Downloads

You will need a couple of programs to get your bot set up.

First you need an IDE or integrated development environment. I would suggest visual studio code or atom below are the download links

VisualStudio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

Atom : https://atom.io
